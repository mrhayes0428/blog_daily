  <p class="first">Today (June 11, 2020) is the first day I try to creat my own blog page with <strong> programming</strong>. Lets see how long it takes me to get proficinent with my programming skills. My goal is to get a job in with in the next 6-8 months. I will be going over the journey, from no idea what I am doing to getting a job.</p>
<p class="first">
  There are 3 programming languages that I plan on tackeling. With solid knowlege of how they operate I will be setting myself up for sucess. Those languages are as follows.</p>
  <ul>
      <li class="list">HTML</li>
      <li class="list">CSS</li>
      <li class="list">Java Script</li>
  </ul>
    <p>
    January 12, 2020 more practicing. Decided that I would go back and redo the training course for HTML again and take notes like i should have the first time. I am also building this blog at the same time that way i can practice what I am learning to see progress. Now I'm making a button just to push, haha. Just tried to change the button color but ended up changing the font color. used the style="color: blue" Now lets see if style="background-color: black" works??? Cool it works. The issue now is that the word color is not showing up. Changed background color to grey for now. Will need to figure out how to change the color of the font... <button>push me and see what happens!!</button>
